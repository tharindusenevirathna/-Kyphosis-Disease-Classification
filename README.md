# Kyphosis-Disease-Classification


This project focuses on predicting the presence of kyphosis—a medical condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine—in patients based on various diagnostic features. This prediction model has practical applications in the healthcare industry, aiming to assist clinicians in early diagnosis and intervention planning.

## Project Overview

Kyphosis is a spinal disorder involving an excessive convex curvature, often resulting in a noticeable "humpback" appearance. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has kyphosis or not based on features such as age and the number of vertebrae affected. By providing an accurate model, this project aims to support healthcare professionals with a tool for reliable diagnosis and assessment.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will:

- **Perform Data Cleaning:** Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
- **Conduct Feature Engineering:** Extract and transform important features to enhance model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data distributions and relationships between features to gain insights and optimize feature selection.
- **Modeling and Evaluation:** Build, train, and evaluate classification models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, using Scikit-Learn.
